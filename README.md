Intro to Github
  
Hello All!

Max here, been dabbling in coding with python and java on and off for years.
Now delving deep into the FreeCodeCamp tutorials, as of 2016-10-26 I am on the first of the Projects,
for Responsive Web Design. 

Shortly I'll be using these skills to help my more entrepreneurial friends create their websites for
their businesses! Stay tuned.
